            <p> Hello! Thanks for being here :) </p> 
            <p> This is my first leap into the world of data analysis, and it’s been a fascinating ride so far! Coming from a business analyst background, my coding skills are still in their infancy. What may seem like a simple album generator is actually the result of a deep dive into data from Rolling Stone's iconic "Greatest Albums of All Time" list. </p>
            <p> Over the last 20 years, this list has seen 5 revisions (some minor and one major), shaking up the rankings of classic albums in surprising ways. My mission? To collect and clean all the official rankings into a single "mega list" and explore how some legendary albums have risen or fallen over time.</p>
            <p> Along the way, I enhanced my MySQL skills and experimented with Python for the first time, extracting data straight from the source. This website is just the beginning of a series of small projects, each building on the knowledge I've gained.</p>
            <p> I hope you'll enjoy this website, which contains the latest update from last year.</p>
            <p> Here’s to music, to Rolling Stone’s ever-evolving list, and to the exciting updates still to come!</p>
